How to Play LCR

1. The game is played with a minimum of three players and no upper limit on the number of participants.
2. Each player starts with three chips.
In each turn, three dice are rolled to determine where the player's chips will go.
	-For each L, the player must pass one chip to the player sitting to the left.
	-For each R, the player must pass one chip to the player sitting to the right.
	-For each C, the player must place one chip into the center pot and those chips are now out of play.
	-Dots are neutral and require no action to be taken for that die.
4. If a player only has one chip, he/she rolls only one die. If a player has two chips left, he/she rolls two dice. Once a player is out of chips, 
he/she is still in the game (as he/she may get chips passed to him/her), but passes the dice to the next player.
5. The winner is the last player with chips.
